# Space LEAF Nano Security & Stewardship (Phase 0)

Status: Simulation-only. No biological deployment. Repair-only charter. Dual consent. Offline default. Immutable audit. Optional soldier layers. Blue Team emotional stewardship (Ocean Cruise). Red Team adversarial testing.

## Goals
- Impenetrable-by-design: zero trust, dual keys (patient + licensed medical), offline/air-gapped default.
- Repair-only scope: no enhancement, no surveillance, no genetic editing.
- Simulation-first: digital twins, synthetic tissue rigs, hardware-in-loop mocks.
- Trauma-mode stabilization: calm cues, safe-mode, dual re-auth for recalibration.
- Diagnostic life updates: chemistry, mechanics, mental state, sleep monitoring (simulation).
- Ocean Cruise: emotional grounding for soldiers; gentle, non-directive support.

## Quick start
- Install: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run CLI: `python -m src.app.cli --scenario zero-ground`
- Execute tests: `make test`
- Security profiles: configure `config/crypto.yaml` and `config/consent_policies.yaml`

## Non-negotiables
- No remote control by default.
- No brain mapping without explicit patient consent (kept on-device under patient key).
- No real-world modulation; all outputs are simulated prompts.
- Advanced care directives govern intervention vs. stand-down.
